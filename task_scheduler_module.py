        Adds a new task to the scheduling system.

        This is a placeholder method. A full implementation would handle
        priorities more effectively (e.g., using a priority queue), manage
        dependencies (e.g., only allowing a task to be dequeued if its
        dependencies are met), and store more comprehensive task metadata.

        Args:
            task_description (str): A human-readable description of the task.
            priority (int): The priority of the task (e.g., 0 = normal, higher = more important).
                            Currently, this is a placeholder and not fully utilized by the simple deque.
            dependencies (list, optional): A list of task IDs that this task depends on.
                                         Currently a placeholder.
            metadata (dict, optional): Any additional data associated with the task.

        Returns:
            str: A unique ID for the added task, or an empty string if failed.
