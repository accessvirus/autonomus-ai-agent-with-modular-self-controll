        Placeholder method to decompose a high-level goal into a sequence of sub-tasks.

        This method is intended to analyze a complex goal and, based on the
        current context and available agent capabilities (actions/tools),
        generate a structured plan of simpler steps.

        How it might be used:
        The agent's core cognitive loop, upon receiving a complex goal, would invoke this:
        `plan = planner.decompose_goal(
            high_level_goal="Organize and summarize research papers on topic X",
            current_context={"topic": "X", "paper_directory": "/path/to/papers"},
            available_actions=["read_file", "summarize_text", "create_report"]
        )`
        The output `plan` would be a list of dictionaries, each representing a sub-task,
        e.g., [{"action": "list_files", "parameters": {"directory": "/path/to/papers"}},
               {"action": "read_file", "parameters": {"file_path": "..."}}, # for each paper
               {"action": "summarize_text", "parameters": {"text": "..."}},   # for each paper
               {"action": "create_report", "parameters": {"title": "Summary of Topic X", "content": "..."}}]

        Args:
            high_level_goal (str): The complex goal string to be decomposed.
            current_context (Dict[str, Any]): A dictionary providing relevant information
                                             about the current state or environment
                                             pertinent to the goal.
            available_actions (List[str]): A list of action types or tool names
                                           the agent can currently perform.

        Returns:
            List[Dict[str, Any]]: A list of sub-tasks, where each sub-task is a
                                  dictionary typically specifying an 'action' and its
                                  'parameters'. Returns an empty list or raises an
                                  exception if decomposition fails.

        Given a plan (a list of tasks) and a list of indices of completed tasks,
